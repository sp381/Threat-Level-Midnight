# Project Two: Threat-Level-Midnight

## Description 
AS a movie lover I WANT a web application to discuss movies, especially movies that are American made and banned in other countries SO THAT I create an open dialoge and hear other unique perspectives. 

## Requirements
* Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

* Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.

* Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

* Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

* Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

* Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
